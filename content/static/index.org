I am a computer graphics researcher pursuing my PhD under Dr. Miguel Ángel Otaduy, focusing in differentiable physics simulations.
With a background in physics from Universitat de Barcelona and a Master's in computer graphics from URJC, I'm passionate about recreating everyday physical phenomena within virtual enviroments.
